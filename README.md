# IUSocial
A Social Network for Indiana University.

The objective of the Project was to build a social media platform called IU Social that connects students and professors, faculty of IU.

It is a fully functional social media website for Indiana University. It is aimed at providing a common platform for students and professors to connect among themselves, share various course related resources, find research students etc. within the university.

We have implemented it using the the following technologies:
1) PHP
2) HTML
3) Bootstrap/CSS
4) jQuery/JavaScript
5) Ajax
6) JIRA (Agile Project Management)
7) MySQL
